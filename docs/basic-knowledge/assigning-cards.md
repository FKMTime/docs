Just search the competitor and scan the card you want to assign to them and click enter. Search the next competitor and repeat the process.

## Check-in

FKMTime has a check-in system that allows you to keep track of who is present at the competition and got their ID (or any other things).

To start, go to the check-in page.

### Cards assigned before the competition

If you assigned cards to the competitors before the competition, you can just scan the card and check-in the competitor.

### Cards not assigned before the competition

If you didn't assign cards to the competitors before the competition, you can search for the competitor, assign card to them and check-in at the same time.

### Newcomers

If you are checking-in the newcomer you have to check if their data matches the data presented on their document (passport, driver's license, etc.).
