# Importing competition

:::important
It is recommended to import competition after creating groups.
:::

To import a competition, you need WCA account with access to the competition you want to import.

After first login to the system, you will be redirected to the import page.

:::note
If you are a WCA Website Admin (WRT/WST/WCAT) you can import any competitions, search bar will be visible. If you are not, you can import only competitions where you are a delegate or organizer.

You will need a scoretaking token that can be taken from WCA Live. Go to the [account](https://live.worldcubeassociation.org/account) page and generate one. This token is valid for 7 days and specific to the selected competition. 

If you plan to host unofficial events and want to send results automatically to Cubing Contests you should copy the token from the Cubing Contests Edit Contest page and paste it to the input field.

Also, you can set how often you want to send results to WCA Live. By default, every attempt is sent immediately after scanning cards. But you can turn it off completely (for testing purposes) or send results every 5 minutes if internet connection in the venue is not stable.

Paste the token to the input field and click the save button.
